# How to approach this module?

- Remember, I think taking notes of the videos is not worth it
- The following is enough and a better approach
    1. Watch the videos (without notes)
    2. Read the papers -> take quick notes
    3. Figure out 2-3 questions
    4. Do the weekly quizzes

**Remember** This module is assessed as
1. 40% First assignment (Quiz or other similar thing, but it's open book)
2. 40% Second assignment (a video recording a presentation and a report)
3. 20% Peer Review
