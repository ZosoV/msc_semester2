## Improtant: Understanding until now


- The fundamental classical approach is:
    1. Initially, the focus was indeed on extracting meaningful edges and contours from images through filters (like Sobel, Canny). 
    2. Subsequently, algorithms (such as Harris Corner Detector, SIFT, and SURF) were applied to these filtered images to detect and describe features that are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, or illumination.
    3. These features could then be used for various applications, including motion capture, object recognition, and scene reconstruction.
- Other possible classical approaches directly apply feature detection algorithms on images without the preliminary requirement for edge filtering, as many feature detectors inherently analyze changes in intensity and spatial relationships to identify features. 
- Lastly, modern approaches often leverage machine learning and deep learning, which can directly learn feature representations from raw pixel data without explicit filtering or feature extraction steps.
